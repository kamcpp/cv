\onehalfspacing
As a casual makeup artist and enthusiast, I have always been developing my skills and keeping them up-to-date and fresh through various methods like watching YouTube or Instagram bloggers, working in a professional salon as an assistant, doing hair styling among my friends, etc. I've studied IT Engineering with expertise in Web Engineering field and I've had many manager and specialist rolls in my career but I have always been a casual makeup assistant to my mother which is a professional makeup artist in Tehran, Iran. So, I have the passion from my childhood and from my mother. I want to make this my main profession for the coming years and I've found it a lot more serious and professional here since my move to Amsterdam with my family. I'm a hard worker, positive and exact person who has a strong personality and I'm totally ready to take any action needed for me to go through the makeup profession from being a junior and assistant to be a real first class makeup artist.
