\section{IN SUMMARY}
\noindent \rule {3.5cm}{0.4pt} \\
As a highly motivated and expert software architect, I have spent more than 10 valuable years dealing with the analysis, design, development, and building large-scale, national, governmental and international enterprise systems and my skills are not limited to a specific development platform. My architectural solutions include a variety of technologies, patterns, and concepts based on C/C++, Java, Python, etc without any pre-biased point of view. As an architect for governmental and international enterprise software, I've always faced strict and risky conditions in which security, performance, data consistency, data correctness, distribution of resources, fault tolerance, high availability, authentication, and authorization, etc have always been important factors. Recently, because of my old academic interest in Data Science and Machine Learning, I have accepted to be a Deep Learning research developer and give possible consultant for algorithm and software development. I am also highly passionate about Astronomy and Cosmology which made me pursue it as an official university degree. Recently, blockchain and cryptocurrencies have been the target of my self-studies and because of my former experience with PKI, the future use and possible alternatives for blockchain are interesting topics to me.
