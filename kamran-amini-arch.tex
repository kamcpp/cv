\section{IN SUMMARY}
\noindent \rule {3.5cm}{0.4pt} \\
As a highly active and motivated professional enterprise software architect with more than of 10 years of experience in analysis, design, development and architecting large scale, national and international enterprise projects, my skills are not limited to a specific development platform and my solutions include a variety of technologies based on C/C++, Java, Python, etc. As an architect of national enterprise projects, I've always faced strict and risky conditions in which security, performance, data consistency, data correctness, distribution of resources, fault tolerance, high availability, authorization and authentication have always been important factors to them. As an example, I've architected Kawthar ePassport Issuance System for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and it is operating world wide in more than of 70 countries.
