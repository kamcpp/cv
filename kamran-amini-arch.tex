\section{IN SUMMARY}
As a highly active, motivated and 'computer science loyal' professional software architect with more than of 10 years of experience in development, analysis, design and architecting large scale, national and international projects, my skills are not limited to a specific development platform and my hybrid distributed multi-tier architectural solutions vast from services written in C/C++, Java or Python to front-end applications written in C/C++, Java or even Web with consideration of critical architectural factors like Distribution of Data and Computation across multiple domains and clusters, Fault Tolerance of services, High Availability of services, System's Single Points of Failure, overall Performance and Efficiency of the system, Security factors and hardening these factors across the system's domains, etc. As an architect of national projects, I've always faced strict and risky conditions which Security, Data Consistency and Data Correctness have been always a very important factor. As an example, architecture of Distributed ePassport Issuance System (Kawthar System) for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was led by me and it is operating world wide in Iran's Consular Offices and Embassies in more than of 70 countries.
