\section{IN SUMMARY}
\noindent \rule {3.5cm}{0.4pt} \\
As a highly active and motivated professional software architect with more than of 10 years of experience in analysis, design, development and architecting large scale, national and international enterprise systems, my skills are not limited to a specific development platform and my solutions include a variety of technologies based on C/C++, Java, Python, etc. As an architect of national enterprise projects, I've always faced strict and risky conditions in which security, performance, data consistency, data correctness, distribution of resources, fault tolerance, high availability, authorization and authentication have always been important factors. Recently, because of my interest in Data Science and Machine Learning concepts, I have accepted to be a Deep Learning research developer to explore this field and give possible consultant for development of software in this area.
