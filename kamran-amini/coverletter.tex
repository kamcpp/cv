For the job role: \textbf{Senior Software Engineer (Golang)} \\ \\

\noindent Hello, \\ \\

\noindent I'm applying for your job vacancy because I feel confident in being a good candidate for your position based on the requirements I read on your job specification. I have some hands on Go and I'm really eager to learn it. Having deep experience with C/C++ and Java will help me learn Go on a faster pace. Besides the mandatory requirements, I have the skills which are considered a plus. They are CI/CD, DevOps, Agile/Scrum, some hands on Go, and experience with MongoDB. I'm looking forward to have your response.  \\ \\

\noindent Best regards, \\
\noindent Kamran
