\section{IN SUMMARY}
\noindent \rule {3.4cm}{0.4pt} \\
As a highly motivated and senior software architect, while having spent more than 12 years in developing and architecting enterprise and distributed software for international companies, my skills cover a wide variety of development tools and platforms. The enterprise projects which I've been involved include a wide range of technologies, patterns, and concepts based on embedded C, C++, Java, Scala, Python, relational and NoSQL databases, etc. As a senior software engineer, I have strong hands on writing codes with various programming languages including C, C++, Java, Scala, Python, and bash scripting while having best practices and enterprise patterns in mind. As a distributed system engineer, I've always encountered with strict and tough functional and non-functional requirements in which security, performance, data consistency, distribution of resources, fault tolerance, high availability, authentication, and authorization have been among them. Recently, I've been working as an expert software engineer at TomTom as a part of Search team in order to make it better and give the customers a better search experience.
